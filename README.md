# Real Estate Data Analysis and Preprocessing
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing on a real estate dataset. The main objectives are:

Understanding the structure of the dataset
Identifying missing values and handling them appropriately
Detecting and handling outliers
Analyzing relationships between variables
Transforming and preparing the data for further analysis 

teps Followed

1. Data Exploration (EDA)

Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values.

Analyzed the distribution of numerical and categorical features.

Identified potential outliers using statistical methods (e.g., IQR, Z-score).

Explored correlations between key features using visualization tools.

2. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values using appropriate techniques (imputation, removal, etc.).

Encoded categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.

Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

Removed or transformed outliers to ensure a robust dataset.

Created new features where necessary to enhance data insights.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy,Skew, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook
